## Project Description

This is a Geonarrative Story Map about the ongoing Ukrainian Refugee Crisis stemming from the Russo-Ukrainian War. It includes an overview of the conflict as well as breakdowns and analysis of the countries that are accepting the highest number of Ukrainian refugees.

## Screenshots

All your files and folders are presented as a tree in the file explorer. You can switch from one to another by clicking a file in the tree.

## Project Goals

Our primary goal and function of the story map is to both educate those who may be in denial of the severity of the issue, as well as provide an accurate map for Ukranian refugees in the act of fleeing to use in order to find the safest and nearest passages to countries that will take them in as refugees.
